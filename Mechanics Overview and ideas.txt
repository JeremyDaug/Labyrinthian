Storage overview

Character
    ->Specializations
		--- Like classes, though more generic in some ways. The key features of Specs are
		--- the abilities they give. They also give a unique form of buff that is permanent
		--- and cannot explicitely removed (they are treated as though directly part of the
		--- stat or skill they buff.)
        ->Abilities
			--- Explained in more detail under the Unspec Abilities, these abilites are tied
			--- to the spec that holds them. They may not be exclusive, to the class or even
			--- require a class to be gotten. If the player already has the ability and the
			--- ability could reasonably stack it will.
        ->Stat Buffs
			--- Self explanatory honestly. (directed at str, dex, end, int, itu, and wil explicitely)
        ->Skill Buffs
			--- self explanatory (goes to skills and is a bonus to them.)
	->Unspec Abilities
		--- You gain the ability to access these abilities as you level up flatly, these are not 
		--- dependent on spec, but usually have skill requirements. If you lose the reqs you lose
		--- the ability. (if perm you must replace it, if temp you just lose it till the temp wears 
		--- off)
		->Abilities
			--- These grant new things to the character. An ability can be an attack (firebolt),
			--- a buff (haste), an allowance (craft robot), or a new option (fly).
	        ->Flags
			    ->AoE, or area of effect
				->DoT, damage over time, or the effect repeats itself over time.
				->Temp, the effect has a duration.
					--- if this is no it is counted as permanent or instantanious. If it has an action it
					--- and no temp it is instantanious, if it has no action, and no temp, then it is passive (permanent).
				->attack, whether you need to hit with something (dependent on type of attack and
				    if it's attached to a weapon AOE never has this)
				->Magic, if it's has magic as it's source. (can be used with tech, but makes it magitek)
				->tech, if it has tech as its source (can be used with magic, but makes the abiltiy magitek)
				->Physical, if the ability effects or is resisted by physical stats.
				->Mental, if the ability effects or is resisted by mental stats.
				->Stackable, if it stacks with itself (all non-like abilities stack)
				->percent, if it uses a percent modifier on it's 'to'.
				->flat, if it gives a flat modifier on it's 'to'.
				->allowance, if the ability is an allowance. 
					--- An allowance is is basically a glorified flag.
					--- Ex, fly is an allowance to ignore all terrain.
					--- Ex. craft robot is an allowance to craft robots from materials.
				->action, if the ability has an action tied to it.
					--- This means that it can be actively turned on/off and activated in combat.
				->limited use, this is a pool or cost that is a cap separate from your own SP/WP pools. 
					--- Ex. Limited Fly on a suit of armor lets you activate the fly allowance 3/day.
					--- Limited use is always either instantanious or temporary. The details of how
					--- the uses are regained are in extras.
			->Ability Packs
				--- These are multiple abilities that are packaged together into one entity. They are
				--- Special in that they must be used together. Ex. Boiling blood includes a buff to STR, but
				--- a DOT effect at the same time. You cannot activate the buff in the pack without getting 
				--- the DOT effect also. All abilities are wrapped in this, even if they are alone.

Statistics

    Strength
        Strength is a measure of physical power.
        - Damage from slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning weapons are scaled off of this.
        - Damage resistance scales off of this.
  
    Dexterity
        Dexterity is a measure of physical accuracy and speed.
        - Every point improves accuacy and chance to hit.
        - Every few points increases the number of attacks you can make.
        - Precision damage scales off of this.
        - Dodging is based off of dexterity.

    Endurance
        Endurance is a measure of physical fortitude and capacity to take damage.
        - Every point is another HP per level.
        - Every point is another unit of time you can go without food and water.

    Intelligence
        Intelligence is a measure of mental calculating power.
        - Damage, defence, and crafting scale off of intelligence.

    Intuition
        Intuition is a measure of mental accuracy and speed.
        - Like intelligence, but works with magic.

    Willpower
        Like endurance, this is mental fortitude and capacity for mental damage.
        - It defines how long you can go without sleep.
        - Every point is more MP per level.

	Health Points HP
		Created by endurance and level. This is the ammount of damage the character can take.
		- Decreases with damage and at threshholds it adds penalties.
	
	Stamina Points SP
		Created by endurance. This is the ammount of energy you have as a character.
		- Can be used for special attacks and maneuvers.
		- Drains over time as you need food to sustain yourself.

	Mental Points MP
		Created by Willpower and Level, this is the ammount of mental damage you can take and still function.
		- Decreases with mental attacks, at threshholds it penalizes the character.

	Will Points WP
		Created by Willpower, this is the ammount of mental energy you have as a character.
		- Can be used for special attacks and similar things.
		- Drains over time as you need to sleep to maintain your will.

Map Rules
	Room connections.
		There are 4 connections a room can have with an adjacent and they are fairly self explanatory.
		- Closed
		- Open
		- Locked
		- Unlocked
	Player interaction with connections.
		A player cannot pass through a closed connection period.
		An open connection is passable, if not immediately traversable (pitfalls and all that).
		A locked connection is impassable, but can be opened. (more on unlocking later)
		An unlocked connection is passable, and can be locked ( more on locknig later)

	Locking and unlocking.
		Unlocking a room that does not exist creates the room in the unlocking process.
		The room that is created is guaranteed to have another door to an uncreated space.
		If a created room is adjacent to another room, the created room will match the other rooms, new
		connections will not be made to old rooms.

		Locking a room will do one of 2 things. 
		If you can still get to that room by another path, it will simply lock the door on both sides
		and that's it. 
		If you cannot reach that room by another path the room is destroyed.

		!!!QUESTION RAISED!!!
		--If you are locking a room from the side of the door that doesn't have the town
		connected to it, should it destroy the rooms anyway or refuse the lock? Refusing the lock limits the
		player and doesn't allow them to challenge themself in stupid ways. Allowing it may cause someone
		accidentally closing it off anyway and effectively stranding them. Locking also effectively means
		the player is unable to respawn as all data in the locked room will be deleted and lost.
		-- We can allow it to happen, but have a double prompt warning of the effects to keep an unexpecting
		player from stumbling into a deathtrap.
		-- We could also do another where, rather then destroying the original rooms, it simply strands the
		room the player is in and moves it elsewhere allowing them to possibly find their way back, but
		increasing the threat of death should they fail to reconnect to the original rooms.
		   -- This last one, while it sounds interesting, sounds like a pain to implement and could 
		   wildly shift between an effective game over and pointless reworking of the map. It would also 
		   potentially break the theming of the directions as the room floats between the four corners to
		   confuse the player purposefully.
		!!!QUESTION END!!!

	Altering room connections
		The player can eventually effect room connections more directly, but the area they should be able
		to do this should be small so they can't abuse it to get anywhere freely. If the player could do this
		anywhere they could easily break the challenge of effective traversal and make the boss 100 rooms
		to the north more like 40 as they remove all paths in the way.
		It should also disallow creating 'dead rooms' where they could potentially put their
		'doomsday device/easy button' and hide it safely away until it is completed. Dead room in this case
		is a room that is entirely closed off, but still exists.
		A potential limit on them is the ability to ONLY open connections. They cannot create doors to lock,
		or close the wall off. This means that if they mess up in opening a connection they may have to 
		destroy and regenerate an entire section of a cell.
		
		!!!QUESTION RAISED!!! 
		-- Should the player be allowed to change connections between cells. The main reason for this is I'm
		kind of thinking in terms of minecraft's loaded chunks, or in this case cells. Allowing connections
		between cells to be permanently opened would certainly mess with this mechanic, however if you don't
		think this is an issue and most (if not all) of the map can be comfortably loaded at the same time,
		then this should not be an issue and intercell connections would be made possible.
		!!!Question END!!!

Disorganized Thoughts
Lineage System and Character interactions


On travel.
1. I did think about that and did not intend for the turnbased mechanic to be used universally, that being said I didn't give too much thought to the external movement outside of a 'fast travel' mechanic where you could backtravel through secured areas to save time or react to issues that arose elsewhere.

I already intended the central most cell(s) to be a guaranteed safezone after the player clears them. From this place they can corral potential allies and build a makeshift town. The town acts as a safe spot where you can craft for long periods of time without worrying about enemies, improve and train your characters in non-combat arts (and develop entirely different combat styles). It also is the basis of the death mechanism.

The game is in permanent Ironman mode, there are no loads, Saves are done automatically, and constantly, and if you die, you die for good. The way the town changes this is that it allows you to create a lineage, either through other people in the town, or through the offspring of the character. The offspring lets you continually build up a character line's power, but if someone else is there, you may use them should no offspring be able to take your place. You can also do creation of pet creatures and robot companions, corral allies and let others rest or train. So on. 

On combat.
2. My main focus in the tactical combat is more on the opponents then the environment. The environmnet may define what you can or can't do, but it should be a modifier against the creatures you fight. They are the main focus. 

There is already planned to be multiple areas, again the 4 cardinal directions lead to a different dominating theme, and the secondary directions lead to the mixed themes that create many possible creatures.

North is magic and is dominated by creatures that are powerful, but easily countered, and also a bit more chaotic (More numerous, but less organized).

South is Tech and is dominated by enemies that are strong, but varied and not easily countered, also they tend to more focused tactics (Less numerous, but will be more organized) 

East is Organic opponents, more numerous, but a bit weaker.

West is Inorganic opponents, less numerous, but far stronger.

Half directions lead to mixing them. 
NE is Magical beasts and creatures who eat magic. 
NW is golems and enemies with magic items who become increasingly powerful and dangerous.
SE is Alien and psionic creatures who disable and debuff enemies.
SW is robots and Cyborgs who can ignore most damage and start being able to hijack tech.

In terms of the random generation, in all honesty it'll be a bunch of predefined rooms with various random elements. In all honesty though, the dungeon itself isn't the source of the challenge, it's the monsters.

On the Lore
3. Plot is like this. You are an amnesiac in a cell, there's a magic plant in the corner that's been sustaining you and some running water in the corners. At some point you started hearing someone else talking to you through the walls and you've build a rapport with them. One day you hear a clinking noise coming from one of the shallow pools of running water and find a large key about the size of a club. Using it to unlock the door and find your way around the first area you find this person and decide that you must find your way out. The only problem is that both of you know that it won't be so easy and prepare for a long slog to find the exit.

TL;DR You find the key through the magic dungeon, rescue your first ally, then proceed to try and find your way to the exit while building up your strength and power.

Stealth is possible, but will ultimately be more risky and less rewarding in the long run, but it'll allow you to scout out areas ahead so you can prepare.

We are rescuing people. Randomly a few will pop up. The weaker ones will often join in immediately, the stronger allies have to be convinced through some way. But, all allies can be trained and specialized to assist you as you need. But, if you don't meet their needs they may turn against you.

Short term goals that can be achieved is increasing the size and sustainability of the town, collecting items and materials for crafting, and exploring new areas with new monsters.
Ultimately if they study enough and make their lineage last long enough they may be able to discover things entirely alien to the dungeon itself and create something from disparate parts that the dungeon would call an abomination.
