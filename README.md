# Labyrinthian
A Rogue-like Dungeon Crawler

Note to Collaborators: Push all important code to Master, but keep the testing branch (testing main) and Release (The complete program) separate. Only pull to these to these branches from master. Never pull from these to master.

I also suggest getting SourceTree as it's pretty good and a allows for more complexity in actions. (such as changing between branches quickly to commit/push).
