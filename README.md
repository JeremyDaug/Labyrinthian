# Labyrinthian
A Rogue-like Dungeon Crawler

Note to Collaborators: Try to keep the branches separate. Any new feature should be it's own branch, and any changes to those files should be in that branch. Pull the branch into Testing Branch if you want to test it, and only when it can be guaranteed to run pull everything (but testing) to master.

I also suggest getting SourceTree as it's pretty good and a allows for more complexity in actions. (such as changing between branches quickly to commit/push).
